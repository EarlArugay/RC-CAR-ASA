# RC-CAR-ASA-
RC Car design, Control System, and Documentation

## Overview
This projects demonstrate the design and implementation of a microcontroller based platform integrating embedded firmware, motor control, and wireless communication. The system was developed following basic embedded systems engineering practices, including modular firmware design, hardware documentation, and version control.

## Key Features
- Wireless remote control (Bluetooth / RF / Wi-Fi)
- DC motor control using motor driver module
- Modular embedded firmware architecture
- Battery-powered system with onboard regulation

## Technologies Used
- Microcontroller: ESP32 C3 SUPERMINI
- Motor Driver: TB6612FNG
- 360 Stepdown Buck Converter
- N20 Motors 12v 500rpm
- 11.1v LiPo Battery
- ipega PG9090 Wireless Controller
- Programming Language: C
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Documentation: Markdown, diagrams

## Hardware Architecture
The system consists of a wireless controller transmitting commands to the onboard microcontroller. The microcontroller processes control signals and drives the motor driver to control vehicle movement.
